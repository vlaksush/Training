# Slides

This contains all the slides used in the workshop

## Project Structure

- **Swift**: Focuses on core Swift topics, such as optionals, control flow, error handling, and more.
- **iOS**: Covers key UIKit topics like building user interfaces, handling gestures, animations, and navigation controllers.
- **SwiftUI**: Provides examples of building UIs with SwiftUI, with an emphasis on state management, view composition, and navigation.

                    Introduction(comments) - no need

  ## iOS ( Training/slides/iOS)  - Technical Introduction of UIKit
      Xcode.pdf(overview)
      iOS Architecture.pdf ( till , iOS Delegate Pattern) then follow the demos

    Training/UIKit => for coding
      MyFirstAppUIKit - ( simple button and text field ) using Storyboard
      Programmatic / MyFirstAppUIKit - (same the above but developed by manual coding)
      
      StoryBoardDemo - ( navigation controller, view controller to another view controller, )
      NewsReader - (TabBar Controller, wkwebview control(delegate) ) - show world demo tab, and sports tab for lab
                (we need one certificate or access for showing this simulator / web access)

          go back slide (iOS Architecture.pdf) - till table view
          
      PalatteNavigator (Table View) - demo
      Training/Starter/UIKit/IndianStockTrader_Starter - Task for Table View
      Solution for TableView (with full MVC with custom delegate pattern) =>  Training/UIKit/IndianStockTracker
      
        go back slide (iOS Architecture.pdf) - till collection view
        
      Training/UIKit/PhotoGallery - demo
      Training/Starter/ProfileGallery - task
        **Note** Solution for ProfileGallery => Training/UIKit/ProfileGallery
        
       go back slide (iOS Architecture.pdf) - till `auto layout`

      Training/UIKLit/AutoLayoutDemo
        (no task - but we can engage them by asking simple questions)
        Demo 1 Scene - Align the controls (3 buttons)
        Demo 2 Scene - Align - little complex - algin
        Demo 3 Scene - Adding Control and constraint (relationship [left/right] ) (programmattically) 
        Demo 4 Scene - StackView Demo
        Demo 5 Scene - Content hugging and compression Resistent( setting priority)
        Demo 6 Scene - Error Viewing / Detecting


      Optional Demo - (or ask them to review ) Training/UIKit/NSLayoutConstruct Demo

      (Optional for AutoLayout using UIKit)  - share few links from udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ios9-auto-layout-course/)

      Optional Demo - Training/UIKit/MyAddress ( using CLLocations - )
